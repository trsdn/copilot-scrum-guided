# Sprint Velocity Tracker

Track sprint-over-sprint metrics for planning accuracy.

## Velocity Table

| Sprint | Date | Goal | Planned | Done | Carry | ~Hours | Issues/Hr | Notes |
|--------|------|------|---------|------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
<!-- Add sprint data here after each retro -->

## Averages

- **Mean velocity**: TBD (will be calculated after 3+ sprints)
- **Mean sprint size**: TBD
- **Recommendation**: Start with 5-7 issues per sprint, adjust based on data

## Notes

- Track velocity honestly — include carry-over items
- Distinguish sprint types: code-heavy vs research vs mixed
- Use velocity to inform sprint planning, not to judge performance
